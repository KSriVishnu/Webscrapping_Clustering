# Webscrapping_Clustering

Goal: Implementing a K-Means Clustering Algorithm to Cluster N Number of Websites based
on their content, extracted using Web scraping with automatic identification of the number of
clusters.

Libraries Involved:
BeautifulSoup,Pandas,Urllib,Numpy,Skicit-Learn,Matplotlib,Requests,Random

1) Extracting the text(not just the landing page, but also from all the links of the landing page) from
the given websites without HTML tags.
2) Using advanced features of web scraping like user-agents with requests.
3) Using one of the Parallel Processing techniques to extract the text.
